# Aircraft Sustainability Platform

The Aircraft Sustainability Platform is a web-based solution that connects aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and recycling facilities to facilitate the repurposing and recycling of end-of-life aircraft components. The platform promotes the circular economy by reducing waste and promoting sustainability in the aviation industry.

## Features

The platform includes the following features:

- A database of aircraft parts that includes information on their material composition, age, and condition, etc.
- A Buy/Identify page that allows manufacturers and airlines to buy/identify components that are nearing the end of their useful life and arrange for their repurposing or recycling.
- A Recycling Facilities page that allows recycling facilities to identify sources of recycled materials, including both metals and non-metallic materials such as composites and plastics.
- A Dashboard page that provides a clear and concise overview of the key metrics and data related to the recycling and repurposing of end-of-life aircraft components.
